# student-anxiety-depression-classify-model

This project aims to classify student anxiety and depression based on textual data sourced from social media platforms. 
The growing concern about mental health among students is a significant issue, and this model seeks to assist in identifying 
potential anxiety and depression cases by analyzing online text comments and posts. The task involves using machine learning algorithms 
to automatically classify and predict mental health conditions in students.
